## Crucial Considerations

1. **Privacy & Consent:**  
   Be transparent with your users. Have a clear Privacy Policy explaining what data you collect and why. Only collect what you need and get explicit consent for marketing emails (e.g., an unchecked opt-in box).

2. **Security:**  
   The more data you store, the greater your responsibility to protect it. Prioritize security, especially for passwords and personal information.

3. **Start Small:**  
   Begin by capturing basic account info and order history reliably. Then, progressively add more sophisticated behavioral tracking as your platform grows.
